				<p>
				During a month, I have been working on the biggest project of my life, the student council campaign. I was the president of my list that was called "Guns'N'Ros√©w - GNW". Our mascot was Leopardo DiCaprio and people loved it. Joking aside, this project taught me a lot about leadership, management and negotiating skills and even though I lost, it was an amazing experience for me.
